   DOWNLOAD TIME CALCULATOR

Hey guys welcome to one of my first projects on python tkinter.
I started tkintering recently and made this Download Time Calculator .
This ones a basic tkinter project which calculates the time a file will take to download .
You can input your file size and your download speed and calculate the time taken with just a single button.
It contains various speed and file size units  to choose from. There is also a button which directly takes you to fast.com where you can check your download speed easily
(Used the webbrowser library for this purpose.)

Furthermore Iâ€™ll add more speed and size units to choose . 
Also I will be adding an inbuilt download and upload speed test inside the program .
